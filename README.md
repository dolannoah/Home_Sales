In this project, we used PySpark to explore and analyze home sales data. We:
- Ran SQL queries to find average home prices by different features
- Filtered and grouped data using multiple conditions
- Saved results as partitioned Parquet files
- Created temporary and cached tables for efficient querying

- Resource:
- PySpark Docs
- Spark SQL Guide
- Databricks PySpark
- Deep Seak
